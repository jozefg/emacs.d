## emacs.d

This is my emacs configuration. It's designed to be plunked into some poor environment and
immediately let me immediately begin working.

This isn't completely dependency free. It expects

 - Emacs   > 24   for package
 - Haskell        for haskell-mode
 - Coq + Coq-mode for init-coq
 - ProofGeneral   for init-coq, it's not packaged with elpa yet
 - Ag             for ag.el
 - Mu4e           for mu4e, this also depends on mu and offlineimap
 - Stuff I'm not thinking of now
